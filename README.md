# tinf0il

A clean, fast proxy portal built on [Scramjet](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/scramjet) with libcurl transport. Browse, play, stream, and work — privately.

---

## Features

### Proxy & Privacy
- **Scramjet proxy** — full URL rewriting via service worker, libcurl transport
- **Tab cloaking** — spoof tab title, favicon, and address bar host; presets for Schoology, Canvas, and Google Classroom; or import from any URL
- **Stealth routing** — strips referrers and telemetry on every request
- **No logs** — zero telemetry, no tracking

### Games & Apps
- **Game catalog** — thousands of unblocked games via [3kh0 lite](https://github.com/3kh0/3kh0-lite), filterable by tag
- **App catalog** — curated list of web apps, one tap to launch
- **Favorites** — pin games and apps for quick access

### tinf0il TV (`/tv`)
A full-featured streaming interface built on Next.js, embedded in the portal.

**Movies & TV Shows**
- Search and browse movies and TV shows (TMDB)
- Trending, popular, and top-rated content on the homepage
- Multiple streaming servers per title with instant switching
- Episode selector with per-season navigation
- Auto Play and Auto Next episode
- Light mode — dims the page when the player is active
- Watch history — continue where you left off
- Personal collection — save titles to a watchlist (requires account)
- Ratings, cast info, and genre metadata
- Comments section per title
- Recommendations based on what you're watching
- Share button — copies a direct link to clipboard

**Live Sports**

**Catalog**
- Search across movies and TV shows simultaneously

- Deep linking — every page has a shareable URL (`/tv/sports`, `/tv/sports/watch/:id`, `/tv/watch/:id`)
- URL bar stays in sync as you navigate within the TV section
- Direct URL access loads the correct page without going through the homepage

### Personalization

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:8787`.

### TV Section (optional, auto-starts)

The TV app lives in `movieverse/` and starts automatically alongside the main server. If you want to run it manually:

```bash
cd movieverse
npm install
npm run dev   # development
npm start     # production (requires a build)
```

To refresh the game catalog from 3kh0 lite:

```bash
npm run build:games
```

---

## Deployment

The server binds to `process.env.PORT` (default `8787`). It walks up ports automatically if the preferred port is in use. Works out of the box on any Node-capable host (Railway, Render, Heroku, VPS, etc.).
